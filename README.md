# ODE solvers for python

#### Rudimentary ODE solver for python (pyode.py)
An algorithm for solving a system of ordinary differential equations (i.e.
ode solver) is shown in these files. The script **pyode.py** solves for 5 equations simultaneously:

Plots for the solution can be seen in the **pyode-solver.png** file.
